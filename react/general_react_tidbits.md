# General Things to Keep in Mind

I think overall, I have been confusing mounting of a component with rendering of the component. However, pretty sure this is flawed. During a component's life-cycle, it mounts only one time to the DOM, but may be re-rendered multiple times. In the case of a class component utilizing `componentDidMount`, my understanding is that the component will first mount to the DOM and its initial state will be created and its `render` method will be called - this is the first render. After the component mounts and the first `render` call occurs, then `componentDidMount` will be called and let's just assume it performs an async network request and sets state to populate the state with data from a back end. The `setState` call changes the state and causes a re-render of the component, __but not a re-mount__ of it. This can be determined if you place a `console.log` statement within the body of the `render` method with a `componentDidMount` method defined - here, you will see that `console.log` twice - once for the first render when the component mounts, and again for a second render after `componentDidMount` causes a state change.
