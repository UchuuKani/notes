## LeetCode

Daily LC problem for May contest (day 1) was `First Bad Version` (https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/)

Makes sense that binary search works here since you are essentially working with a sorted array from 1 to n. My gap in understanding right now is knowing how you can prove that binary search will find the correct element - I understand that if the midpoint is **NOT** a `badVersion`, then all points before and including the midpoint can be discarded so the `left bound` should be re-assigned to the value of the `midpoint + 1`.

- also understand that that if the midpoint **IS** a bad version, that tells us that the midpoint may or may not be the first bad version, but we can tell for sure that all versions that come after the midpoint are bad so we can assign `right bound = mid` to omit anything after the midpoint

### Gap in Understanding

- the terminating condition of our while loop where `while (left < right)` intuitively makes sense but can't really put into formal words why it is guaranteed to be correct - LC solution links this article `http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs211/2006sp/Lectures/L06-Induction/binary_search.html` and there is a Geeks for Geeks page for binary search here `https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/`

- also don't entirely understand why calulating mid as `mid = Math.floor((leftBound + rightBound) / 2);` may overflow (in certain languages) but `mid = leftBound + Math.floor((rightBound - leftBound) / 2)` is guaranteed to not overflow
