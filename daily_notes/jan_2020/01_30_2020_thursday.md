## Word of Mouth, Panna SD - Find Path to Node in Binary Tree

### My Approach

- One function that takes `root` node, `target` value, and `path` array defaulted to `[]`
- Conditions to check
  - if `root` is `null` (`return path`)
  - if `root.val` equals target (`return [root.val]`)
- After conditions do:
  - asd

```javascript
function findNodes(root, target, path = []) {
  if (!root) {
    return path;
  }
  if (root.val === target) {
    return [root.val];
  }

  path.push(root.value);
  path.concat(root.left, target, path); // these calls return a new array and I don't capture the value
  path.concat(root.right, target, path); // this too
  return path; // wouldn't see changes from concats
}
```

- Solution doesn't work, this is just my initial attempt
- Could potentially make it work if I use conditions to check if last element in path array is the target, then somehow return through call stack to return final, correct array. **Don't know how to go about that though**

### Solutions

- Both solutions create the solutions as methods for a binary tree class, where as I tried to write a function that took a root node and a target value and returns the path as an array

  - This should really change approach though since no other binary tree methods are used in solutions

#### Spaghet solution 1

- asd

#### Spaghet solution 2

- Function takes a `root` and `target`
- Initialize an `output` array that will hold nodes from current path
- Define a function `go` to do recursion, takes a node that defaults to `root`

  - base case false: if the `root` passed in does not exist, return false as there are no more paths to try
  - push the `root`'s value into `output`
  - if base case true: if `root` is the `target` value
  - if recursive case true: go through nodes to the left and we find the target
  - if recursive cases true: go through nodes to the right and we find the target
    - function is below, the recursive cases are shown in second `if` statement with `OR ||` pipes
  - recursive cases false, no paths found to `target`: pop the last node off the output array since going further is a dead end
  - return `false` to bubble up a falsey value

- invoke `go` helper function to populate `output` array
- return `output`

  ```javascript
  function findNodes(root, target) {
    const output = [];

    function go(node = root) {
      if (!node) {
        return false;
      }
      output.push(node.value);
      if (node.val === target || go(node.left) || go(node.right)) {
        // if any of these expressions evaluates to true, this if statement runs
        return true;
      }

      output.pop();
      return false;
    }

    go(); // this call returns a boolean, value is only used to bubble up for recursion

    return output;
  }
  ```

### Reflection

- I forgot that the `concat` method returns a copy of the array, doesn't mutate original
- Thought my original approach would work at first, but then after trying to run through given example, realized I would be pushing addtional node's values into path array even if I found the target
  - Could potentially add conditions to avoid this, but Spaghet solutions don't seem to do anything like it
- Instead they use helper functions to do the recursion and bulk of the work, outer function just acts as a container that calls the helper
- **Note**: Seems like when going through tree problems (or recursive problems in general where an array or sum or string, whichever) where a solution is being built up, often times seems easier to set up a data structure to hold results in an outer function, and define a recursive helper that mutates the data structure in outer function to add or remove results
  - I have tried to do these types of problems with a single function, no helper, and no outer data structure to store results (just one passed in to original function call), but have never made it work
  - Probably possible, but more difficult to reason about, at least for me
