## Project Work - Expense Tracker

- Looking into using UPSERT with unique constraint to create tags if not already in tags table
- **NOTE**: probably need to create a `transactions` route so that I can `GET` tags associated with an individual transaction, `PUT` to update tags associated with a transaction, other actions to be decided

- **TODO**: look up html element to render a calendar for date picking
- When someone `POST`s to a userId, want to:
  - add `transaction` to transcations table
  - set variable response as the response I will build up and send to the client. Will at first attach the returning values from `transaction` query in `transactions` table
  - try to create tags in `tags` table if they don't already exist
    - **if the case where no tags are added, forego rest of transaction**, can wrap entire thing in an if statement checking if incoming `tags` string is not empty
    - **Case where `tags` string is not empty**: need to attempt a `bulk upsert` to add any tags that don't exist already and return `tag_id` for every tag that needs to be associated with a transaction so that relation can be made in join table
  - add `transactionId` and `tagId` to `transactions-tags` join table
  - return transaction info (description, amount, date) and tag info (tag_name) as JSON to the client
- Looking into `ON CONFLICT` clause in Postgres for upserts (believe there was a Hashrocket video on YouTube about this that I checked, should revisit)

## Mastermind Implementation

- Can be done in any medium (CLI, web app, mobile app)
- Premise is that a user attempts to guess a 4-number combination and a computer should be built to play faciliate playing the game
  - After each guess, the computer should provide feedback
  - The player loses if they do not guess the combination in 10 guesses

### Considerations

State:

- The correct guess, int[]
- Number of guesses made or remaining guesses, 0
- The player guess, int[]
- Status: playing, win, loss - String
- History object with keys `{guess: int[], message: String}` stored in an array {History}[]

## InfoSys Interview

- Asked to write a function that took in `head` of a linked list and an integer `k` that swaps the first `k` elements till the end of the list, e.g. for list `1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> 14` and `k = 4`, output should be `8 -> 3 -> 5 -> 1 -> 14 -> 12 -> 10`

- Someone else asked me to code up a counter component in React with buttons to increment and decrement the count, then followed up and asked how I could separate out the buttons into their own components, just had me write them as functional components without any state

- Was asked questions about my experiences with various technologies, then that was most of the interview
- Was asked how I could allow `cross-origin requests` (or something to that effect) in an Express app
  - I had no idea how to answer **look up later** - wasn't asked this after I said I did not know
