## Berg Data Structure Question First

- Design a data structure for MTA functions such as swipe in, swipe out, and print average trips given a station

### Ideas for Problem 1

- For `Swipe In` and `Swipe Out`

  - Swiping in or out (slightly different from MTA, no swiping out really) should be associated with some unique ID so that we can track the time it takes to go from one station to the other
    - Some odd cases:
      - A `swipe in` without a `swipe out`
      - A `swipe out` without a `swipe in` (fare evasion probably)
      - A rider has to leave from one station, and enter another to get to their desire location
        - Technically, the first station they swipe out of is not their whole trip - maybe this situation is not common enough to address with our data structure
    - What should be done in these cases?
  - Should track a unique ID associated with card when someone swipes
    - A new ID is assigned every time a card is purchased
    - IDs should be a key in some hash table potentially
      - likely to insert into rider key table often (new cards being purchased)
  - **Stations should have unique IDs** as well, differentiated from cards, or in their own structure potentially
    - Would remain relatively fixed, so no need to insert, delete, update very often - can probably be slow operations

- `Average subway travel times for a station`

## Berg Data Structure Question Second

- Design a data structure for keeping track of a constant stream of stock exchange data and printing top 10 stocks based on how often it was traded

### Ideas for Problem 2

- Constant stream => probably a lot of inserting data (optimize time for inserting)
- Stock exchange data? Price per stock, identifier, date
  - Would I be deleting a lot, or updating based on identifier
    - Probably updating mostly - updating when identifier price changes, and how price changed
      - To quickly update, probably need to optimize searching speed
- Need to keep track of how often stocks are traded - one entity buys a stock that another is selling
- Top 10 stocks based on how often it was traded

- One instance of a stream represents a purchase and a sell?
- Maybe use trees for O(log n) insertion and searching for balanced trees
  - Could combine other data structures to achieve other desirable properties
- Could sort stock data based on identifier, each node has identifier and number of exchanges

- Pete Idea: max heap where sorted value is number of transactions
