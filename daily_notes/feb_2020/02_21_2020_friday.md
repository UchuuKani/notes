## Neudesic Phone Call

- Basically a smaller consulting company
- Mostly work with .NET stack (C#, Azue, Sql Server)
- Offering 80-85k
- Relatively small, I would potentially be put on client projects quickly, not expected to contribute to .NET projects immediately
- Need to set up technical phone screen with hiring manager early next week, though he is out Monday and Tuesday
  - Doesn't take calls between noon and 2, which is problematic for me

## Berg Deets

- Good to know:
  - Flatten Multi-level Doubly Linked List
  - 1-D Candy Crush
  - Move Zeroes (follow-up, do it in less than `n` time)
  - Walls and Gates
    - Mentioned LRU Cache being a good problem to know
