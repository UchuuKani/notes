## LC # 103 - Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

- I did not get this, tried to do normal BFS with a queue where I would switch from pushing left or right children first based on a counter indicating level, but realized this would not work

### LC Approach 1

- Uses BFS, with a double-ended queue - not sure how this works

### LC Approach 2

- Uses two stacks in a DFS fashion - not sure how this works

### LC # 1047 - Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String

- Sort of used a stack, not really
- My solution is below

```javascript
var removeDuplicates = function(S) {
  const stack = [null, S[0]];
  let index = 1;

  while (stack.length && index < S.length) {
    const prevLetter = stack[stack.length - 1];
    const currentLetter = S[index];

    if (currentLetter !== prevLetter) {
      stack.push(currentLetter);
    } else {
      stack.pop();
    }

    index++;
  }
  stack.shift();

  return stack.join("");
};
```

## LC DB # 1082 - Sales Analysis I

- My solution is as follows:

```sql
select seller_id
from sales
group by seller_id
having SUM(price) =
(select SUM(price)
from sales
group by seller_id
ORDER BY SUM(price) DESC
LIMIT 1);
```

- Alternative solution seen in discuss, similar to mine (takes advantage of the fact that `ORDER BY` takes place after `SELECT`)
  - This person aliases `SUM(price)` in the subquery as `total_price` and references that in the `ORDER BY` clause

```sql
select seller_id from Sales as seller_id
  group by seller_id
  having sum(price) = (
      select sum(price) as total_price from Sales
      group by seller_id
      order by total_price desc
      limit 1
)
```

### LC Solutions

```sql
SELECT
    (SELECT DISTINCT
            Salary
        FROM
            Employee
        ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary
;
```

and

```sql
SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
```
