## LeetCode # 39 - Group Anagrams

### My Approach

- Write helper that checks if two strings are anagrams of each other, runs in O(w) time with O(w) space to compute
- Create `containerArr` to hold outputs
- Create `grouped` hash table to keep track of all words that have been added already
- Iterate over `strs` input array
  - keep track of each visited word
  - iterate over rest of `strs` array and check if subsequent words are anagrams of current
  - if they are, add them to `grouped` and sub array
  - if not, skip the loop
- Return `containerArr`

- My approach does not work, need to revisit later or just understand LC solutions

### LC Approach 1

- Two strings are anagrams if and only if their sorted strings are equal

- Maintain a hash map `answer: {string -> array}` where each key is a sorted string and each value is the array of strings and each value is the list of strings from the initial input that, when sorted, are equal to the key. Something like:

```javascript
answer = {
  aet: ["ate", "eat", "tea"],
  ant: ["tan", "nat"],
  abt: ["bat"]
};
```

- Time complexity given: `O(n k logk)` where `n` is length of input array `strs` and `k` is max length of a string in `strs`. Using an outer loop has O(n) complexity, and sorting each string takes `O(k logk)` time
- Space complexity given: `O(n k)` for storing the array of arrays that is returned as the answer

### LC Approach 2

- Categorize by count (seems closer to my approach in this regard)
- Actual implementation seems much different however (using unicode?)
- **TODO**: revisit later

### JS Solution in Comments by haoyangfan

- Seems like implementation of first approach

```javascript
var groupAnagrams = function(strs) {
  let map = new Map();
  for (let str of strs) {
    const s = uniform(str);
    let l = map.get(s) || [];
    l.push(str);
    map.set(s, l);
  }
  return Array.from(map.values());
};

var uniform = function(str) {
  return str
    .split("")
    .sort()
    .join("");
};
```

- **Note**: was considering potentially adding up unicode values for all characters as a check, but then those computed values are not guaranteed to be unique, so would not work

## LC # 151 - Reverse Words in a String

### My Approach

- Edge cases: leading (`"___hello my dude"`) or trailing white space (`"the cat is big____"`) or both, and strings that have multiple spaces in their body (`"the big dog___leaps over the fox"`). The `_` is used to represent white space since not sure how to make Prettier avoid it when formatting
- Trim the string
- Create new array that is created by splitting on white space
- Create new array `processed` to hold only words, does include inner white space (could use filter)
- Return `processed` after reversing it and joining with white space `" "`

### LC Approach

- Solution is hidden
- **TODO**: review discussion later

## LC # 24 - Swap Nodes in Pairs

### My Approach

- Not fully fleshed out
- Create `dummy` node to hold new list
- Pointers to `current` node and `previous` node
- Iterate while `current.next` is defined:
  - `temp` var to hold next node in list
  - assign `previous` to `current` node
  - set `previous.next` to `temp.next`
  - move `current` node to `previous.next` node

### LC Approach

- Solution is hidden
- Discussion posts seem to either use recursion or a dummy node
- **TODO**: Review again later

## LC # 21 - Merge Two Sorted Lists (attempting again)

### My Approach

- Inputs: `list1` and `list2` point to heads of lists
- Use `dummy` node to keep track of head of new list
- Use a `current` pointer initially set to the `dummy` to track current node
- Iterate while both inputs lists are not empty
  - If `list1.val > list2.val`
    - Attach `list1` to `current.next`
    - Advance `list1` to its next node
    - Advance `current` to `current.next` (node that was just added to the new list)
  - Else, do same operation but add `list2` to the new list
- If `list1` empty, attach current `list2` node to `current.next` (`current` points to the last node added while iterating)
- Else, `list2` is empty and remainder of `list1` should be attached to `current` node
- Return `dummy.next` as it is the head of the newly formed list

## Bloomberg Questions to Review

### Feel Ok About Implementing

- Merge Two Sorted Lists, LC # 21, Feel pretty good about it, Linked Lists
- Unique Paths, LC # 62, Feel pretty good about it, DP with a matrix
- Same Tree, LC # 100, Feel ok about it, binary tree traversal
- Min Falling Path Sum, LC # 931, Feel pretty good about it, DP with a matrix
- Merging Meeting Times, LC # 56, Feel ok about it, array manipulation and sorting (sort of greedy? Maybe not really)
- Odd Even Linked List, LC # 328, Feel ok about it, LinkedLists
- First Unique Character in a String, LC # 387, Feel pretty good about it, string manipulation
- Move Zeroes, LC # 283, Feel pretty good about it, array manipulation using two pointers - kind of sliding window?

### Not Confident Implementing / In Understanding

- Kth Smallest Element in a BST, LC # 230, can do brute force solution but not sure about optimal, BST
- Linked List Cycle, LC # 141, feel ok about implementing but not in how it's a correct solution (done on Cake before), Linked Lists
- Validate BST, LC # 98 (also Cake or Algo Expert), not confident in how to implement, BST
- Min Stack, LC # 155, thought I knew how to implement (use two stacks) but was not able to complete, stacks
- Group Anagrams, LC # 49, able to form an approach but not one suggested in solution, string manipulation
- Binary Tree Level Order Traversal, LC # 102, just BFS need to review (use a queue), BST
- **Longest Substring without Repeating Characters**, LC # 3, checked solution using set and kind of understood, sliding window
- 3Sum, LC # 15, understand general approach but don't understand how to avoid duplicates, arrays
- Swap Node in Pairs, LC # 24, had an approach but did not check if valid, Linked Lists

### Completely Lost / Don't Understand Why It Is Correct

- Maximum Sub Array (Kadane's Algorithm), LC # 53, DP with a matrix but don't understand how it is correct, DP
- Pascal's Triangle, LC # 118, lost in implementation details but is fairly straight-forward, nested arrays
- Longest Palindromic Substring, LC # 5, have a naive working solution, DP?
- Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II, LC # 117, had an approach but checked solution and not too similar, binary trees
- Copy List with Random Pointer, LC # 138, had approach written out but not coded, Linked List

### Haven't Attempted

- Implement Stack Using Queues, LC # 225
- Merge Sorted Array, LC # 88 (done on Cake before apparently)
- Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array, LC # 26
- Word Search, LC # 79
- Unique Paths II, LC # 63
