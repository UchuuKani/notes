## Mastermind

- To implement different difficulty levels, could maybe put most of game logic into a higher-order component and move the pieces of state that need to change depending on difficulty level (attempts, timer, maybe number of items that need to be guessed) a level above in the component tree
- This will be so that the components that render the the elements the user sees will depend on props to render things such as the remaining attempts, timer, etc. rather than initializing state based on props (and methods which affect those specific pieces of state will need to be hoisted up another level in the component tree)
- So after creating higher order components, will use them to create three separate components for three separate difficulties that get conditionally rendered, and certain elements of the UI will be displayed in each component from props from the parent element
- Would need to be able to restart game on win or lose, and take the player back to the difficulty selection screen while resetting the pieces of state that depend on difficulty level
- Also need to figure out how to make `select` / `option` elements go back to a default value so that the last guess before winning or losing is not displayed when the game is reset

## Vim Commands

- `A`: "In normal mode press A (uppercase). Vim will be switched to insert mode, and the cursor will be moved to the end of the current line ready for input."

## Yext Junior Database Reliability Engineer Prep

- 1-2 years experience as a database administrator in MySql
- 1-2 years experience in SQL programming
- Experience of administering MySql databases
- Experience installing and setting up databases
- Experience with database Monitoring and Diagnostic
- Understanding of database security, authentication and permissions
- Knowledge of database systems architecture, schemas and buffers / cache
- Experience creating database objects, indexes, stored procedures, triggers etc.
- Knowledge of database normalization and constraints
- Knowledge of database replication, backup and restore
- `Some experience writing software that utilizes databases`
  - can talk about Grace Jammer (schema design)
  - can talk about Expense Tracker with Postgres
- Linux administration including scripting (bash/python)
  - `Can sort of talking about trying to learn some Bash and Python as well as general linux administration`
- `Experience with source control tools git/gerrit`
- BS in Computer Engineering, Computer Science, or a related field, or similar college level education

### Preferred Requirements

- Knowledge of automation tools such as Ansible and Terraform
- `Some experience working with CI/CD (Jenkins, TeamCity)`
  - Have worked with Travis
- `Some knowledge of programming languages like (Java, Go, Ruby, C)`
  - Javascript, can talk about trying to learn Clojure / a functional language

### Maybe Pitch

- Mechanical engineering from Florida
- Moved to NYC and started working a job at company tangentially related to construction
- Accessed building records using one of the city's databases
- Tried to automate the process of looking up records and filling out documents so got started with programming/trying to script my job
- Eventually got me interested in web development and Fullstack
- At Fullstack, learned about creating front and back ends as well as interacting with a database both with sql and and ORM
- Grace Jammer project interesting point for me was designing reasonable schema for our database - enjoyed the process of iterating through ideas as well as figuring out how we'd base our whole app just based on the schema

### Talking About Grace Jammer DB Aspect

- Considered options for representing cart - either as its own table, or as a special state of an order - chose the latter. Was also considering representing orders as a Json array in Postgres to connect to products, but opted to use a many-to-many between orders and products with a join table
- Also had to consider fact that doing floating point math is subject to rounding errors, so made decision to store prices in cents (INT) in the database and render a price on the front end by dividing by 100

### Talking About Learning About Basic Linux Operation

- Can talk about permissions (rwx) for different users - user, user group, anyone (chmod)
- Talk about setting up Postgres on WSL?
  - Maybe not b/c I have no idea what's going on with it actually
