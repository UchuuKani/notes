## TripleByte Zoom Meeting

- Presented by Ammon Bartram of TripleByte

### Advantages of Remote Interviewing

- Candidate gets to work in their own programming environment
- Remote interviews are better for diversity - Lowers psychological bar, fights imposter syndrome sort of - Less bias on part of the interviewer

### Disadvantages of Remote Interviewing

- RIs can be inconsistent / noisy

### Actionable Items

- Use Structured Interviews
  -Decide what skills matter for your company
- Use Better Interview Questions - Avoid leaps of insight, e.g. Recursive Staircase problem kind of needs that leap to realize it's just Fib sequence - it's a bad problem - Better question might be to implement Mine Sweeper in terminal or React, whatever - Avoid specialized knowledge - Caveat is that the hire should be very familiar with something in some cases. In general though, test for generalist knowledge e.g. array manipulation, hash tables, strings. Don't test for advanced data structures
- Ignore Credentials - Credentials ARE meaningful - But should not let them bias skills evaluations - Interviewers tend to be biased towards interviewers with more prestigious backgrounds
- Have Diverse Interviewers - Many different ways to be good - You want interviwers with diverse skills from diverse backgrounds

## Remote Interviews Make it Hard to Close

- How do you show what your company is like to the candidate?

### Actionable Items

- Make sure the interviewer takes the RI seriously - be punctual, don't multitask, hand off to the next interviewer
- Keep camera on, make eye contact, active listening
- Find ways to show your culture

## React Training with Cassidy Williams: Reducers

Reduce in Javascript can be used to do something like sum up all the numbers in an array:

```javascript
const numberArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

const total = numberArr.reduce(sum, 0); // => outputs 15
```

In the context of using a reducer for state management in an app, can think of each number in the `numberArr` array as a state in the app. The `0` could be considered the initial state of our application

We can write a reducer function that takes application state and some action, and return a new state from that combination:

```javascript
function reducer(state, action) {
  return state + action;
}
```

Can kind of think of the `dispatch` function as a way to add to our "state" array. Dispatch actions to the reducer to create a new state.

One reason it's nice to use a reducer is that you know where your state changes are happening (all in the reducer). Something wrong with state is in `reducer`, and something wrong with whatever is changing state from a `dispatch`

Also nice to be able to create custom hooks using useReducer. Say we are using the exact same values of state elsewhere in a React app, then we don't have to redefine all state variables and individually use them in each component. Can wrap the reducer in its own custom hook like `useMyReducer` where you return `state` and `disaptch`. This is good for global states, e.g. when using `context`.
