### Adding Typescript to My React Code

For some reason, in my `index.tsx` file with code as follows:

```typescript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";
import * as serviceWorker from "./serviceWorker";
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router>
    <App />
  </Router>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Having the `App` component be a self-closing element throws an error `Parsing error: '>' expected`, but if I use a closing tag `<App></App>` then the code compiles. Why is this the case?

- Didn't end up figuring out why, and there are still TS errors in my `Routes` component, but the app still compiles
- Ended up writing `interfaces` for `User` and `Transaction` as `IUser` and `ITransaction` that I used to to fix compilation errors by using those interfaces to define `Props` interfaces in certain files
  - Not sure if the way I defined the interfaces is really the best way to go about it. Examples below.

```tsx
interface ITransaction {
  description: string;
  amount: number;
  transaction_date: string;
  transactionId: number;
}

interface IUser {
  name: string;
  user: string;
  emailId: number;
}

// one component where I use the ITransaction interface: Transaction.tsx
interface Props {
  transaction: ITransaction;
}

const Transaction = ({ transaction }: Props) => {
  const { description, amount, transaction_date } = transaction;
  return (
    <div>
      JSX stuff where I use props {description}, {amount}, {transaction_date}...
    </div>
  );
};

// one component where I use the IUser interface: User.tsx
interface Props {
  user: IUser;
}

const User = ({ user }: Props) => {
  const { name, email } = user;

  return (
    <div>
      JSX stuff where I use props {name} and {email}...
    </div>
  );
};
```

My concern is: should my `ITransaction` and `IUser` interfaces just tell my React app what the shape of the returned data is? Should there be any optional fields, e.g. for components that don't use all of the properties being passed down in props? Should the interfaces be specific to whichever properties each component is using, e.g. for `({transaction}: Props)` where `Props` is just an interface saying `transactions: ITransactions`?

Also of note, since my `useAxios` custom hook takes two arguments where the first is the `userId` and the second is an option `config` object, should I import something like `@types/axios` to give a typing to the `config` parameter?
