## React Training Stream - useEffect

- What is a side effect in context of React?

  - Most likely side effect you'd encounter is a network request

- Every time you setState, component will re-render - yup knew that
- If we were to cause a side-effect that uses setState outside of a `useEffect` call, will cause an infinite loop because setState will cause re-renders
- useEffect will delay when the body of the component renders

"On the first render, does React paint and then repaint when it reruns the useEffect?"
React Training: "yes, if the effect causes a re-render"

"So use effect functions are in the event queue?"
React Training: "Don't think of them like events. Effects run on mount, and then they run again when anything in their dependency array changes. If the array is empty, then they only run on mount. If the array is not present, it will run on every state change. Think of them as staying in sync with the component and the variables in the dependency array!"

"In my experience, I'd have a promise in my useEffect, then have a loader...until my data comes back and causes a rerender. Cool?"
React Training: "@adebiyial that's cool, I'd say to definitely break up your components as much as possible so as few things have to re-render as possible"
