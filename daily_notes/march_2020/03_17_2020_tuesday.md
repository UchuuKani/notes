## Peter Coffee Chat Advice

- Try to make it feel as natural as possible

### Questions Potentially to Keep Conversation Going

- How did they get their role? Out of Launch Day? Cold apply, referral?
- What did they focus their time on? Algos/DS, project work, an even split?
  - Type of applications? Cold applies, long applications, Lots of networking?
  - Advice they have to focus on?
    - A lot of advice was focus on basics learned at FSA, e.g. Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, SQL
- Overall job hunt experience?
- Anything they would have done differently? Anything you know now that you wish you knew during the job hunt?
- At end of convo, maybe, ask for a referral - "Hey saw this position, I'm kind of interested"
- Ask if they recommend anyone else you should talk to, whether it be a cohort mate or someone else
