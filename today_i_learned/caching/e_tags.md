# ETags

- Used for caching

## Trade-offs

### Negative

- When combined with a load balancer set up, since ETags are generated per server, if a different server handles a client's request the ETag generated by one server won't match the one generated by a different one
  - Generally, with web servers such as Apache, they can be configured to generate the same ETags across servers
